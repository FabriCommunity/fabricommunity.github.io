# Fabric Community Information

The Fabric Community is an unofficial community that provides a safe, friendly environment for people of all backgrounds
to get together, socialize, talk about Fabric, and create Fabric mods. It aims to act as an alternative community that
addresses the apparent contempt for minority groups in the Fabric community at large, through inclusive policy and
active, responsive moderation.

We believe that a community should exist to serve the needs of its users. To that end, we try to do the following:

* Be transparent about moderation actions in public
* Clearly document our policies and explain what we expect of our users
* Educate ourselves on threats to vulnerable groups, and use that education to take a stand against bigotry and harmful 
  speech
* Get our users involved with important decisions and changes to the community
* Gracefully accept feedback from our users and work directly with the community to implement changes based upon it

**Note:** This site is a living, breathing form of documentation. It will change over time as we encounter new 
challenges and attempt to overcome them. We're always interested in feedback, so feel free to chat with us in
`#discord-meta` (or via a private message) if you need anything!
