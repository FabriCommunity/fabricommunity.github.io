This proposal is the first version of our community policies and guidelines, and it marks the first time we've

This proposal contains the following set of documents:

* A rules document that outlines the basics of how people should behave, and how reports can be made
* A new Code of Conduct for our community
* A moderator guidelines document that attempts to explain our mindset and what we expect from our staff
