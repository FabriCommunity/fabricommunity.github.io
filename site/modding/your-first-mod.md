# Making your First Fabric Mod

1. Set up the **Java Development Kit** (commonly abbreviated as a _JDK_), so you can work on Java projects (which Minecraft mods are a subset of).  
I recommend using [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).  
Select "OpenJDK 8 (LTS)" - this is the version of Java the official Minecraft launcher bundles,
so you should use it - and click on the "Latest release" button to download the installer.  
Then, simply run the installer like any other application.

2. Set up an **integrated development environment** (commonly abbreviated as an _IDE_) that supports Java.  
I recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download), as its the most supported free Java IDE.  
If you've installed IDEA, you can also optionally install the [Minecraft Development plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327-minecraft-development),
which helps with various tasks. <!-- FIXME make this description actually mean something -->

3. Download the [example mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod) to get a properly set-up envioronment.
<!-- TODO should we make our own example/template mod? -->

<!-- TODO add a "basic vocabulary" section, maybe? -->
<!-- TODO add a "my first block/item" section here -->
