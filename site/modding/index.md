# Fabric Community Documentation

Welcome to the Fabric Community Documentation. This open-sourced Markdown-based documentation can
help you learn how to utilize the Fabric mod loader and community made libraries to make your mod!

## Where can I start?

Here are some great places to get started:

- [Making your first Fabric mod](your-first-mod)
- [Migrating from Forge](migrating-from-forge)
- [Making textures](textures)

## I want to help!

You can checkout the [GitHub for the Contributing Guide](/contributing/editing), and [our Discord to chat about your changes](https://discord.gg/X4YYb96Aj5).
