<p>Like many communities, our policies are based on a Code of Conduct. Please make sure you read it before making use of
our spaces, as it provides a set of behavioural guidelines that we expect everyone to adhere to.</p>
<div class="columns ">
<div class="column is-half">
<article class="message is-danger">
<div class="message-body ">
<p>This Code of Conduct applies to everyone that makes use of all spaces managed by The Fabric Community, which means you
are required to read it. <strong>Not having read the Code of Conduct is not a valid excuse for breaking it,</strong> and it will
still be enforced regardless.</p>

<p>While we try to go into detail with our examples, it's impossible to cover every possible situation in one document. In
general, treat others how you wish to be treated - if you wouldn't like to be treated in a particular way, don't treat
others like that either!</p>

<h2 id="our-pledge"><a href="#our-pledge" id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</a></h2>
<p>We as members, contributors, and staff members pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity &amp; expression, nationality, physical or
mental disabilities or differences (regardless of intensity), politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation,
socio-economic status or subcultural affiliation.</p>
<p>We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community,
and we are committed to promoting these concepts.</p>
<h2 id="our-standards"><a href="#our-standards" id="our-standards">Our Standards</a></h2>
<p>We expect the members of our community to participate in a positive, authentic and deliberate way. Consideration,
respect and empathy are key when it comes to building and supporting a healthy community, and we request that our
members exercise this through their actions.</p>
<p>Please take into account that online communities bring together people from many different cultures and backgrounds.
It's important to understand that sometimes the combination of cultural differences and online interaction can lead to
misunderstandings — that is why having empathy is very important.</p>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrating empathy, patience and kindness toward other people</li>
<li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li>
<li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
<li>Respecting others' personal choices, even when they don't line up with yours</li>
<li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience</li>
<li>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind</li>
<li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
<li>Threats of violence, or violent acts towards others</li>
<li>Public or private harassment</li>
<li>Intentionally dead-naming or misgendering others</li>
<li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
(&quot;doxxing&quot;)</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any unacceptable forms of behaviour</li>
<li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enforcement-responsibilities"><a href="#enforcement-responsibilities" id="enforcement-responsibilities">Enforcement Responsibilities</a></h2>
<p>Staff members are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.</p>
<p>If a community member engages in behavior violating this Code of Conduct, the staff members of this community may take
any action they deem appropriate. Actions may range from a simple warning to the most drastic: permanent removal from
the community, exclusion from any interaction, and loss of all rights in the community.</p>
<h2 id="scope"><a href="#scope" id="scope">Scope</a></h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (both online and offline), and also applies when an individual
is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an
official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an
online or offline event.</p>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies to all projects, repositories and community spaces that are managed by The Fabric
Community, regardless of whether or not the use of this code is explicitly called out. We also reserve the right to
retroactively enforce this Code of Conduct when community members violate it in spaces not managed by The Fabric
Community.</p>
