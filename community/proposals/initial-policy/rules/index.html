<p>We expect everyone that makes use of all Fabric Community spaces to adhere to the following rules. If you have any
questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact a member of staff on Discord or ask your question in the
<code>#discord-meta</code> channel.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Ignorance of our rules is not an excuse for breaking them. You are responsible for educating yourself on
how every community you join expects you to behave, and &quot;I didn't know that was in the rules&quot; will not fly with us.</p>

<p>The world is a big place, and many people will have a different native language. The common language in our community is
English, but we appreciate that not everyone speaks English at the same level.</p>
<p>If you're not a native English speaker, please try to speak English to the best of your ability. Don't worry if you need
to use a translation tool, or if your English isn't great - we won't make fun of you, and we'll help you figure out the
right words if you get stuck.</p>

<p>Treat other people how you wish to be treated. If you would not be happy to be treated a certain way, do not treat
other users that way.</p>
<p>Everyone has a different background, and we expect you to respect that fact. We will not tolerate hateful, abusive or
discriminatory behaviour in our community. Additionally, please try to be understanding of other users when reading
their messages - not everyone communicates in the same way or with the same understanding of English, and some users
may be suffering from disabilities that affect the way they talk.</p>

<p>The staff team is here to support the community, keep it running smoothly, and ensure that it remains safe and friendly.
In order to allow us to do our jobs, we need you to cooperate with us.</p>
<p>Essentially, please take requests from staff members seriously and listen when a staff member asks you to do something.
If you have a problem with what a staff member is asking you to do, we advise that you step away from the situation and
send a private message to another staff member.</p>

<p>If you need help with a project, you will not be provided with it if your project may break laws, breach a Terms of
Service or EULA (belonging to any organisation, not just Discord), or be considered malicious or inappropriate.</p>
<p>Additionally, keep your code appropriate. Do not sexualize your code or use any slurs or other forms of derogatory
language, either in the code itself or in the assets or filenames that make up your project.</p>

<p>We provide a number of channels for showcasing and informing users about your Fabric-related projects. Outside these
channels, we will not tolerate advertising or any other form of spam. In particular, posting large numbers of images or
lines of text together can be particularly disruptive, and we'd prefer you make use of a pastebin site or image
uploading site when sharing a lot of text or images.</p>
<p>We may remove links to other Discord servers, communities and projects at our discretion if we feel like they've been
posted inappropriately, rather than to start or contribute to a discussion.</p>

<p>Most of our channels are strictly on-topic, and we expect our users to take note of a channel's topic and stick to it.
We understand that conversations may span multiple topics and move onto something else, but we may ask you to move if
a conversation leaves the scope of a channel's topic.</p>
<p>Additionally, when entering a channel with an active discussion, please be mindful of that discussion and do not try to
derail it - by talking over it, for example. We have multiple general (off-topic) channels you can use if a channel is
busy.</p>

<p>Do not mention names from MCP, Mojang or other proprietary mappings outside the <code>#mod-dev-alt</code> channel. If you wish to
talk about proprietary mappings (or working with them), you can gain access to this channel by using the <code>-mcp</code> command
in the <code>#bot-commands</code> channel.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, everyone is here to be themselves in a safe community - to talk about Fabric, or other topics.
We ask that everyone try to exercise empathy and understanding when interacting with other community members, and, if
possible, to step away when things get heated.</p>
<p>We all have a responsibility to build the community we'd like to be in, and that starts with thinking about how you
behave here. Together, we can build a safe, inclusive and friendly space for everyone.</p>

<p>To report rule-breaking behaviour in public, mention the <strong class="has-text-modertater">@Modertater</strong> role directly in the
channel, and a staff member will be along as soon as they can be. Alternatively, you can send a private message
directly to any staff member.</p>
<p>If your report concerns a member of staff, please send a private message directly to <strong>a different member of staff</strong>.
All private reports will be treated with confidentiality.</p>

<h3 id="enforcement"><a href="#enforcement" id="enforcement">Enforcement</a></h3>
<p>Our staff team have multiple tools at their disposal when dealing with rule-breakers, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verbally/textually warning or correcting users</li>
<li>Forcibly changing a user's nickname</li>
<li>Temporarily muting users</li>
<li>Temporarily or permanently removing users from the community (kicking, tempbanning, banning)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each situation is unique, and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. All actions taken in response to rule-breaking
behaviour is done at the discretion of the moderator in question - however, we will take feedback from community members
if they're not happy with how things were resolved.</p>
<p>We do not currently have a way to appeal community bans. While we're figuring that out, feel free to add <code>gdude#2002</code> as
a friend and send your appeal in a private message.</p>
<h4 id="moderation-guidelines"><a href="#moderation-guidelines" id="moderation-guidelines">Moderation Guidelines</a></h4>
<p>Moderation is a complicated subject at best, and it requires a lot of nuance and difficult decision-making. While
it's impossible to enumerate every possible situation (and some situations will not suit our documentation), we've done
our best to explain how we come to a decision, and what we expect from our staff team.</p>
<p>For more information on this, feel free to read
<a href="/community/moderation">our moderation guidelines</a>. If you have any feedback on this document, feel free to contact us!</p>
