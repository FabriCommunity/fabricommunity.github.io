# Fabricomm Site Licensing

In order to best serve the modding community, this repository (and the site itself) is dual-licensed. Primarily, our
assets (templates, CSS, JavaScript and images), page content and documents are licensed under the 
[Creative Commons BY-NC-SA License](/LICENSE-CC-BY-NC-SA.md), with one exception - all **code samples** that end up 
displayed on the site are licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero License](/LICENSE-CC0.md).

We decided on this licensing model for several reasons:

* Those that contribute to our site should be credited for their work, and that work should not be abused.
* People that learn from our resources should be able to use any of our code samples in their own projects, without
  worrying about licensing.

Because we require contributions to meet the terms of these licenses, all content that's been submitted must either be
**content you created yourself**, or content that you have permission to re-license under our licensing model. To be
clear, **we do not want content that has been directly copied from other sources**, unless you have a compatible 
license for that source, or the content you're contributing.

If in doubt, please contact one of the admins. Naturally, we reserve the right to block users from contributing if they 
intentionally or repeatedly break the above requirement. This is non-negotiable.
